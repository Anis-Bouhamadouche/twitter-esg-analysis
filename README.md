# twitter-esg-analysis
This is an NLP project that uses twitter data to look at the relationship of words that appear in ESG related tweets.
The three main notebooks for the project represent different stages:
1. **Twitter API Connection:** I used Twitter API to fetch tweets that are ESG related
2. **Twitter ESG Analysis:** in this notebook I have performed few exploratory analysis tasks to get familiar with the data and gain initial insights, then proceeded with few NLP and Network related tasks such as word frequencies and co-occurrence networks.
3. **Topic Modelling:** in this notebook, I have performed topic modelling on the data using Top2Vec.

For additional details, please refer to the report in this repo.
